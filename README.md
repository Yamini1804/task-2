NAME: YAMINI S COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS ID:CT08DJQ DURATION:12,DEC 2024 TO 12,JAN 2025 DOMAIN:FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT TOPIC:Real time chat application

This real-time chat application is built using WebSockets for real-time communication and React.js for the front-end interface. The backend, developed in Node.js, establishes a WebSocket server that listens for client connections. Upon receiving a message from a client, the server broadcasts it to all other connected clients, enabling seamless, real-time communication. The React.js front-end provides a user-friendly interface where users can view chat messages in a scrollable chat window and send messages via a text input field. The messages are displayed in chronological order, with the user's own messages prefixed as "You." The application maintains an active WebSocket connection, ensuring messages are delivered instantaneously. This setup demonstrates efficient client-server communication and is ideal for applications requiring real-time interactions, such as chat rooms, live notifications, or collaborative tools.
